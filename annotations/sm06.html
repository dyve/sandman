<H5>Title</H5>
<P CLASS="page">&quot;24 Hours&quot; is a song by Joy Division (see page 2, panels 6-7).</p>

<h5>Page 1</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">First known appearance of Bette Munroe. She does not appear in other than this issue.</p>
<p class="anno">&quot;Betty Munroe&quot; sounds an awful lot like &quot;Betty Monroe&quot;, the friend of Brad and Janet that is mentioned in the song <cite>Dammit, Janet</cite> at the very beginning of <cite>The Rocky Horror Show</cite>. In the movie version (<cite>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</cite>), Betty Monroe makes an actual appearance.</p>
<p class="panel">Panel 4-5</p>
<p class="anno">These are probably motion lines; if Bette's hands were shaking like this, she'd be spilling coffee all over the place. Also, she has no reason to be nervous, since she is just doing her normal job, &quot;pretending to be a waitress&quot;.</p>

<h5>Page 2</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">The woman is Judy, we will find out shortly. She is wearing a number of pins and buttons. One reads "Rude Girl," another consists of an "A" inscribed in a circle, which is a symbol of anarchy. This is Judy's first known appearance. "Rude Boys" and "Rude Girls" were members of the late 70's, early 80's punk and/or gay scene in Britain. In particular, fans of two-tone or ska music, originally from Jamaica, were referred to as "Rudies." Also visible among Judy's buttons are a smiley face, and the two interlocking "female" symbols that are more 
clearly visible on the back of her jacket in panel 7. The smiley face is pretty common as a button, but it might also be a reference to <CITE>Watchmen</CITE>, or to Boss Smiley, who we will meet in the <CITE>World's End</CITE> storyline of <CITE>Sandman</CITE>. A normal smiley face has no &quot;cheeks&quot; at the ends of its mouth, while this one has, and so do Boss Smiley's face and the Comedian's smiley. <CITE>Watchmen</CITE> is an excellent (and that's an understatement) limited comic book series written by Alan Moore.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Dear Abby is a syndicated advice columnist. Earl Wilson was a gossip columnist who focused on the entertainment field. He had been dead for a while when this story was published, although his column might have been continued under his name. Jackie Collins writes trashy highly unrecommended novels.
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Johnny Carson is a late-night talk show host. Note the sheep picture in the upper right corner.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">Another sheep picture.</P>
<P CLASS="panel"> panel 6-7</p>
<p class="anno">Judy is a lesbian and Donna is her lover; they've had a fight. Joy Division is a techno-punk/New Wave/gothic band from the late 70's-early 80's. They have a song titled &quot;24 Hours&quot;. The lead singer killed himself, and the rest of the band formed New Order, which further engendered Electronic, Revenge, and The Other Two! [sic]. The symbol is actually two traditional female symbols interlocked. The
male symbol is a circle with an arrow pointing about 30 degrees clockwise of vertical, like the second female symbol on the jacket. This is clearly a lesbian symbol. Bette's expressed attitude (disapproval but tolerance) toward lesbianism is one shared by a great many Americans (generalization: typically small town Christians). Donna will appear later in the series. There is another sheep picture in panel 7.</p>

<h5>Page 3</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">First known appearance of this young man, named Mark. Also another sheep picture.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">First known appearance of Kate and Garry Fletcher (named explicitly shortly).</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">Again a sheep picture.</p>

<h5>Page 4</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1:</P>
<DIV CLASS="anno"><P>First known appearance of Marsh. Note the sheep picture. Bette is singing <CITE>Zip-a-dee-doo-dah</CITE>, from the Disney movie <CITE>The Sog of the South</CITE>. This is ironic foreshadowing, since the complete lyrics are:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CITE>
<P>Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay<BR>
My, oh my what a wonderful day!<BR>
Plenty of sunshine heading my way<BR>
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay</P>
<P>Mister Bluebird on my shoulder<BR>
It's the truth, it's actch'll<BR>
Ev'rything is satisfactch'll<BR>
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay<BR>
Wonderful feeling, wonderful day!</P>
</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Needless to say, it won't be a wonderful day for Bette and the others.</P>
</DIV>

<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">The cast is complete, with one small exception.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">The man in the corner is John Dee, also known as Dr. Destiny, as explained in previous annotations. He possesses Morpheus's ruby, which has great power over dreams, and over reality. Note that he does not get a sheep picture.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</p>
<p class="anno">Bette and Marsh are lovers.</p>

<h5>Page 5</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</p>
<p class="anno">The object to the right of the ruby is the amulet of protection originally obtained from the demon Choronzon in #1. Note that it never gets used that we are made aware of, and we do not learn what becomes of it later. It is possible that Morpheus' recovery of his helmet has nullified the trade, and so rendered the amulet powerless. Dee might be holding onto it for sentimental reasons.</p>

<h5>Page 6</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">Another sheep picture. By now we can be sure that the recurring images of sheep, present whenever we see the Dee's prisoners, indicate them as victims to be. The caption describes them as flies, analogous to flies in a spider's web of course.</p>

<h5>Page 7</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">Rose will appear later.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3-6</p>
<p class="anno">"Secret Hearts" is a fictional soap opera, a genre of American daytime television primarily concerned with overblown romantic activity. Soap operas are serial in nature. "Secret Hearts" actually has antecedents in the DC universe. It was the title of an old DC romance comic. Later, Supergirl acted on the soap opera "Secret Hearts" while her strip was
running in <CITE>Superman Family</CITE>. This was pre-Crisis, of course. The balloons in panels 4-6 are parodies of soap opera dialog. If one Siamese twin becomes HIV positive, the other one by necessity is as well. The illustration in panel 6 is an example of how sex is used to advertise everything, even canned peas.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 7</p>
<p class="anno">Mrs. Cavanagh has not yet appeared again. Cavanagh is more typically spelled &quot;Cavanaugh&quot;.</p>

<h5>Page 8</H5>
<P CLASS="page">Another fictional example of an American television genre, the children's variety show, typically featuring humans interacting with puppets, interspersed with cartoons. There is also a cultural fascination with dinosaurs that unfortunately does not extend to fascination with accuracy.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 7</p>
<p class="anno">The instructions on how to cut one's wrists are traditional; it is allegedly easier for the paramedics to stop the bleeding if the wrists are cut straight across. Cutting down the wrist opens up the veins and arteries along a greater portion of their length.</p>

<h5>Page 9</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 7</p>
<p class="anno">Donna and Judy fought at least partly because Judy struck Donna.</p>

<h5>Page 10</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">Mark is the young man who was waiting for the interview.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">Garry is the male half of the Fletchers.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Kate is the female half. Note the Marilyn Monroe pictures in the background.  This would play nicely with the infidelity worries - the late president of the United States John F. Kennedy cheated on his wife with her, and Marilyn often symbolizes the kind of woman wives worry about their husbands getting involved with. Note the four sheep.</p>

<h5>Page 11</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Stephen King is an American best-selling writer who popularized the horror genre in the last two decades. One of his famous novels, <CITE>It</CITE>, was seen in Sandman #1.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">One of the buttons on Judy's jacket appears to read "Sex Pletch", but was probably meant to read "Sex Pistols," one of the early British punk bands.</p>

<h5>Page 12-13</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">This is a double page spread. Dyke is slang for lesbian.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Marsh's attitude is also the same as a great many Americans.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Another sheep picture.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">Mark is cutting off his left index finger. The word "GOD" has appeared on Dee's chest.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</p>
<p class="anno">This is a right hand passing the severed finger to Dee so it might be Mark's hand. Notice, however, the placement of the fingernail on the hand's index finger, an anatomical impossibility.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 8</p>
<p class="anno">Mary Gentian's name is a poke at Neil Gaiman's friend Mary Gentle. Mary Gentle is the author of several fantasy novels. TV journalist Mary Gentian will appear again in the Sandman series (#37, #68).</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 9</p>
<p class="anno">Fundamentalism is a sect of Christianity which believes in the literal word of the Bible. Armageddon is the prophesied end of the world.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 10</p>
<p class="anno">First known appearance of "The Amazing Herschel and Betty".</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 12</p>
<p class="anno">"Rays" (from outer space) are a popular component of many crackpot conspiracy theories.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 13</p>
<p class="anno">It is generally perceived that local television news broadcasts are light and fluffy, with no concentration on hard news, where a transition from an end of the world story to a tap-dancing duck story is neither ironic nor unnatural.</p>

<h5>Page 14</H5>
<DIV CLASS="page">
<P>This is Kate speaking. Sex with dead people is called necrophilia. A male corpse cannot have an erection, however, as illustrated by the quote below, an erection is not required for a female necrophiliac to derive pleasure from a male corpse.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>From an interview with Karen Greenlee, a necrophiliac, in the book <cite>Apocalypse Culture</cite> (1987, 1990, Feral House) edited by Adam Parfrey:</P>
<P><b>Interviewer:</b> The question I am most often asked is, &quot;How does she do it?&quot;</P>
<P><b>Greenlee:</b> Yes, that's THE question! People ask questions like that--even people who seem pretty cool, seem to have open 
minds--then when you tell them, they say, "That's very interesting," then don't want to have much to do with me. I don't mind telling people how I do it. It doesn't matter to me, but anyone adept sexually shouldn't have to ask. People have this misconeption that there has to be penetration for sexual gratification, which is bull! The most sensitive part of a woman is the front area anyway and that is what needs to be stimulated. Besides, there are different aspects of sexual expression: touchy-feely, 69, even holding hands. That body is just laying there, but it has what it takes to make me happy. The cold, the aura of death, the smell of death, the funereal 
surroundings, it all contributes.</P>
<P><b>Interviewer:</b> The SMELL of death?</P>
<P><b>Greenlee:</b> Sure, I find the odor of death VERY erotic. There are death odors and there are death odors. Now you get your body that's been floating in the bay for two weeks, or a burn victim, that doesn't attract me much, but a freshly embalmed corpse is something else. There is also this attraction to blood. When you're on top of a body it tends to purge blood out of its mouth, while you're making passionate love... You'd have to be there, I guess.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In panel 8, it is to be assumed that Kate tasted or drank the corpse's blood, while kissing it.</P>
</DIV>
<H5>Page 15</H5>
<P CLASS="page">The theme music is indeed correct for the 60s television show "The
Addams Family"</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">The hammer and nails will become important shortly.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Since we do not see what is going on here, almost every word balloon could belong to anybody. Most are miscellaneous love-making grunts. Note that the word balloons are coming from both sides of the partition; we seem to have more than one couple here.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4-6</p>
<p class="anno">The text in the background is mostly unreadable except for occasional short words like "BIG". At the bottom, the text reads, more or less "...sheep come walking [scratched out misspellings of "knocking"] knocking toking on my clocking electric dreams of t.v. screens fiends of chiefs and cheese and late-nit[e]/commercials that don't make sense walking in electric dreams and robots dreams of comic book canibal [sic] sheep/wolves emty [sic]/
...coats...tether [?] and wandering floors with water and silks" This could be an allusion to <CITE>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</CITE> by Philip K. Dick (basis for the movie <CITE>Bladerunner</CITE>). Another sheep reference, this time without a picture though.</p>

<h5>Page 16</H5>
<P CLASS="page">In this sequence, the three women take the roles of the Hecateae, reintroduced in issue 3. Dee repeatedly demands a prophecy until he hears what he wants to hear. All prophecies are true though. Notice that Judy has lost her shirt, which is consistent with Judy being involved in the sex scene on the previous page. Also note that the women are arranged in a maiden/mother/crone order.</P>
<P CLASS="page">Also note the clock in panels 2 and 4: it is the exact same clock we saw on page 11 of issue 4. The clock will return again this issue. It appears that a xeroxed copy of the same illustration has been used, since only the coloring and the size seem to vary. The clock might serve as a link between the literal Hell of issue 4 and the Hell on Earth that the occupants of the diner are forced to endure in this issue. If the clock is intended to mean that Lucifer has anything to do with the affairs in this issue (which I do not believe), we have an inconsistency with a future appearance of Lucifer (<CITE>Sandman</CITE> 23, page 18, panels 1-3 (Lucifer referring to mortals): &quot;I have never <STRONG>made</STRONG> one of them do <STRONG>anything</STRONG>. Never.&quot;).
</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Kate seems to be referring to Arkham Asylum here, where John Dee just came from. Bette is in the role of Atropos, who cuts the thread of each person's life as it ends, in Greek mythology.</p>

<h5>Page 17</H5>
<P CLASS="page">A lot of sheep pictures in the side gutters.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 5-7</p>
<p class="anno">No one dies here. We clearly see all six people in the diner alive on page 19.</p>

<h5>Page 18:</H5>
<P CLASS="page">Notice that Bette is holding the nails while Marsh does the hammering, with his left hand.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Marsh confesses to providing an alcoholic with an almost unlimited supply of alcohol. He is correct in saying that this is tantamount to murder.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 8</p>
<p class="anno">Marsh confesses to having purchased Bette's son while in jail for purposes of sodomy.</p>

<h5>Page 19:</H5>
<P CLASS="page">This page more or less describes typical mammalian pack behavior. Note the sheep pictures in the left side gutter.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</p>
<p class="anno">The television quote is the radio tag for "The Wolfman."</p>

<h5>Page 20</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">It appears that Mark is really dead.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Dee is recounting the fairy tale of Snow White. He has regressed the audience to childhood. Perhaps it is interesting to know that Neil Gaiman has written a new version of Snow White, called <A HREF="http://www.holycow.com/dreaming/stories/snow.html" TARGET="_top" onMouseOver="window.status='Read Snow, Glass, Apples'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';"><CITE>Snow, Glass, Apples</CITE></A>. This story was published as a fund-raiser for the <A HREF="http://www.cbldf.org" TARGET="_top" onMouseOver="window.status='Visit the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';">Comic Book Legal Defense Fund</A>.</p>

<h5>Page 21</H5>
<P CLASS="page">The last sheep pictures appear on this page. Also this is the last page where any of the victims are still alive.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">The song is named something like "Spread a Little Happiness;" it is an old British popular song from the interwar era. It's played on BBC radio 4 and used in a commercial for butter. The rock star Sting later recorded a version that appears on the soundtrack to the movie _Brimstone and Treacle_. Bette has cut Marsh's hand off with the cleaver, which is why it is bloody.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">Judy stabs herself in the eyes with cooking skewers.</p>

<h5>Page 22</H5>
<P CLASS="page">The sign in the upper left reads "Please and Thank You are the magic words." All the victims appear to be dead, with the possible exception of Kate. Dead or not, she seems to have finally gotten what she has wanted from Garry, considering their positions and Kate's professed necrophilic nature. Also note the clock.</P>
 
<H5>Page 24</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">The skewers are no longer in Judy's eyes.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Morpheus has recovered from his trauma in the previous issue and has made his way to where his ruby is.</P>
