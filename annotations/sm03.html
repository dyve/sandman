<P CLASS="page">This woman will be identified later. This is her first known appearance.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3:</P>
<P CLASS="page">The poster is the cover of Frank Zappa's 1984 solo album <CITE>Them or Us</CITE>.</p>

<h5>Page 2</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">The lyrics are the opening lines of the title song. There are variations in the lyrics; at least one live source has the opening phrase as "Say 'nighty-night.' "</p>

<h5>Page 2</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">This is John Constantine, whose background was described in the <A HREF="sm02.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Read the Annotations for Sandman 2'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''">Annotations of the second issue</A>. Constantine is pronounced with the tine of a fork, not the teen of an adolescent.</p>

<h5>Page 3</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">When things happen, John Constantine is in the middle of them. That is his nature.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Constantine has historically suffered from nightmares, mostly due to the fact that a lot of his friends get killed as a direct or indirect result of Constantine's actions.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">The lyrics are from a song called "Mister Sandman" by the Chordettes, a girl group from 1954.</p>

<h5>Page 4</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</P>
<P CLASS="anno">John Constantine used to sing with a (fictional) punk group called Mucous Membrane back in the 70s. An interesting thing to know about Constantine and his (past) association with rock music is that Constantine was initially modelled in some ways (including physically) after the rock musician Sting, formerly of the group The Police.</P>

<p class="panel">Panel 3-4</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The lyrics are from a Patsy Cline song, "Sweet Dreams," also covered by Elvis Costello on the album "Almost Blue." The lyrics may have also appeared in the comic <CITE>Badlands</CITE> #4. The song is considered a classic "proof" of a singer's a capella ("without accompaniment") abilities.
<p class="panel">Panel 5-6</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Mad Hettie is a London baglady whom Constantine has encountered somewhere in the Rick Veitch run of <CITE>Swamp Thing</CITE>. She is insane, a prophet, and very old.</p>

<h5>Page 5</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Note that the punk on the far left bears some resemblance to the demon Choronzon, which is probably coincidental.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Oneiromancer is another title for Morpheus. It literally means "one who predicts the future by the interpretation of dreams" but the -mancer morpheme has acquired in science fiction/fantasy/comics the more generic meaning of "magician" so that "oneiromancer" here probably means "wizard with power over dreams".</p>

<h5>Page 6</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</P>
<P CLASS="anno">I am not familiar with the practice of "creeping"; it may be exclusively British, or more simply a short-lived phenomenon.</p>

<h5>Page 7</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</P>
<P CLASS="anno">In a world where Superman really exists, it is not surprising that people would dream they were he. (Nor in this world, either!) "Last son of a dead planet" is a reference to Superman's meta-title, "Last Son of Krypton." This is also the title of a quite good novel by Elliot S. Maggin.</p>

<h5>Page 8</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The lyrics are from "Sweet Dreams" by the Eurythmics.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The lyrics are from "Dream Lover" by Bobby Darin. It was a #2 hit in 1959.
<p class="panel">Panel 3</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The lyrics are from "Power of Love" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. They were used in public service messages about AIDS in Britain. The Ley-lines (pronounced like the name Lee) are a particular reference to a case of Constantine's, the Fear Machine, which ran for something
like nine issues in the teens of <CITE>Hellblazer</CITE>. Leptons are a class of fundamental particles in physics. A plasma is an aggregate of charged particles; "Plasma fields" is incorrect jargon and sounds like New Age crap.</p>

<h5>Page 8, panel 6<BR>
Page 9, panel 1</H5>
<P CLASS="anno">A reference to the legendary Stanley-Livingstone meeting in Africa.</p>

<h5>Page 9</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Chas is a friend of Constantine from Hellblazer.
<p class="panel">Panel 7</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The faces in Morpheus' cloak might simply be simply random. They might also be the faces of people who are dreaming, and therefore currently in his realm.
<p class="panel">Panel 8</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The "big green bloke" is Swamp Thing, who has been involved in several of Constantine's cases.</p>

<h5>Page 10</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The name above the door of Chas' lock-up is F W Chandler, so presumably it's not Chas' name. I suppose it's most probably the name of a previous owner or the person from whom the lock-up is rented. I did wonder if it might be Chas' father. Chas Chandler was bass player with the Animals and Jimi Hendrix' manager, but there seems to be no reason for an allusion here.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The volumes (diaries?) labeled <CITE>Brujeria</CITE>, <CITE>Plant Elemental</CITE>, </CITE>Crisis</CITE>, and <CITE>American Gothic</CITE> all refer to Constantine's first appearance, a case with Swamp Thing (<CITE>Swamp Thing</CITE> #37-50) that was directly related to the <CITE>Crisis on Infinite Earths</CITE> crossover series. <CITE>Liverpool</CITE> and <CITE>Tibet</CITE> are references I do not recognize.</p>

<h5>Page 11</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</P>
<P CLASS="anno">This is the Chas of page 9. "Venus of the Hardsell" refers to a song that Constantine used to sing as a member of Mucous Membrane. The lyrics and a "textual video" piece are included as the second story in </CITE>Hellblazer</CITE> Annual #1. &quot;Venus of the
Hardsell&quot;. is a pun on the nickname &quot;Venus of the Half-Shell&quot; for a painting by Botticelli called &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;. The image is quite famous, and crops up in a number of places. Magritte used it in at least one of his paintings, and it was also used in Terry Gilliam's version of <CITE>The Adventures of Baron M&uuml;nchausen</CITE>. <CITE>Venus on the Half-Shell</CITE> was also the title of a novel by Kilgore Trout, a fictitious author who crops up in many of Kurt Vonnegut's novels. (The book was actually written by SF author Philip Jose Farmer.)</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</P>
<P CLASS="anno">I do not know of any way that Morpheus "rewarded" Chas.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Rachel is the girl from Page 1. "The Lupus Affair" is an unknown case of Constantine's. "Lupus" is Latin for wolf; it is also a disease of the connective tissues. In <CITE>Batman</CITE> 255, "Moon of the Wolf," Professor Milo (comics' only mad pharmacist) gives Anthony Lupus a drug which accelerates his natural pilosity into full-fledged lycanthropy. The story ends with Lupus hunting wolves in Alaska, searching for a cure. Lupus returned in <CITE>Detective</CITE> #505. The "Lupus Affair" may therefore refer to an untold encounter Constantine had with Lupus. Constantine may have referred to Lupus or the Lupus Affair
elsewhere.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</P>
<P CLASS="anno">In the late 60s, Stan Lee and John Buscema did a overblown philosophical comic called <CITE>The Silver Surfer</CITE>. Drugged-out hippies loved it; it became extremely popular for a short while. Issues of that run are worth quite a bit of money. Besides undergrounds, they are the only sorts of comics likely to be found in head shops.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The lyrics are from a song by Roy Orbison, "In Dreams". The song is featured prominently in the soundtrack of David Lynch's movie </CITE>Blue Velvet</CITE> The song includes the line "In dreams I walk with you", which is printed on the <CITE>Sandman Special</CITE> cover.</P>.
<H5>Page 13</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</P>
<P CLASS="anno">I interpret this to mean that Constantine recognized the danger of fooling with something he didn't understand and thus did not try to open the pouch. This seems to conflict with page 9 panel 3, which I interpret to say that Constantine tried and failed to open the pouch. The registration number on the car (K23 PNBO or possibly K23 PNBOI) is not a valid UK number. The number on Chas' taxi earlier is a valid number, so the artist appears to be aware of 
UK registration practice, but I can't see anything significant in the invalid number - probably just an incomplete understanding of UK numbering.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Another new power of Morpheus. By this time we should mostly be aware that he can affect reality in any way he chooses, subject only to the writer's whims; he can be thwarted only by other beings with similar levels of power.</p>

<h5>Page 14</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Morpheus can see in the dark.</p>

<h5>Page 15</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Constantine's dream of falling from an airplane is a reference to his involvement in a plane crash in <CITE>Swamp Thing</CITE> #71, "Fear of Flying," by Rick Veitch. Neil Gaiman will later write a Sandman story for <CITE>Vertigo Preview</CITE> titled "Fear of Falling" that is reminiscent of this dream.</p>

<h5>Page 16</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Morpheus enters Constantine's waking dream to pull him out.</p>

<h5>Page 20</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Rachel's lines are from the old Everly Brothers song "All I Have to Do Is Dream".</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</P>
<P CLASS="anno">We are never told how Rachel managed to open the pouch; this is important because we are specifically told earlier than Constantine could not on page 9.</p>

<h5>Page 21</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Rachel's line about the setting sun is from a Kate Bush song, "The Dreaming," taken from the album of the same name.</p>

<h5>Page 23</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Constantine believes that he is going to Hell because he believes he has caused the deaths of so many friends and acquaintances. He does not realize Morpheus is being literal.</p>

<h5>Page 24</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</P>
<P CLASS="anno">"Newcastle" was Constantine's first case, in which an exorcism went badly wrong and Constantine went mad for a while. He was then treated by the Dr. "Piggy" Huntoon (see <A HREF="sm02.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Read the Annotations for Sandman 2'; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=''">Annotations for issue 2</A>).</P>

<p class="panel">Panel 8-9</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Constantine is singing the song from page 3.</P>
