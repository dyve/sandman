<H5>Note</H5>
<P CLASS="page"><CITE>The Doll's House</CITE> and <CITE>Sandman</CITE> #8 both contain an introduction written by Neil Gaiman explaining the story thus far. The introduction does not appear in <CITE>Preludes and Nocturnes</CITE>. <CITE>Sandman</CITE> #8 also contains words of praise for <CITE>Sandman</CITE> (and Neil Gaiman) from many writers and artists, both of comic books and mainstream fiction. The introduction is illustrated by original art by Mike Dringenberg in #8. The illustrations in <CITE>The Doll's House</CITE> are different and more general. The notes below about the illustrations refer to the ones in #8.</p>

<h5>Introduction (page 1)</H5>
<P CLASS="panel">Upper right</p>
<p class="anno">The Tarot traditionally has 22 Major Arcana, numbered 0 to 21. The Sandman card is done in the style of one of the Major Arcana, but its number 34 suggests that a larger set of Major Arcana exists than is familiar to our world. This ties in with a remark in <CITE>The Doll's House</CITE>.</P>
<P CLASS="panel">Lower right</p>
<p class="anno">The talisman has many features in common with traditional protective circles. The five pointed star inscribed in a circle is typically a pentacle or pentagram. The lettering around the rim is also traditional; this lettering looks to be runic in nature, which strikes me as somewhat odd. Note that all three tools of Dream have representations on the talisman.</P>
<P CLASS="panel">Paragraph 4</p>
<p class="anno">The figure is Destiny.</P>
<P CLASS="panel">Paragraph 10</p>
<p class="anno">Neil Gaiman says that the name of Roderick Burgess's house, Fawney Rig, is significant, being "named by Lady Johanna after the manner in which she acquired it." Fawney Rig is a con in which a gilded brass ring is sold for less than it is supposedly worth (if it were gold), but much more than what it is actually worth. The ring would be dropped and picked up before the mark, so it was also referred to as fawney-bouncing. Lady Johanna's con was presumably done on a larger, more complex scale. Lady Johanna Constantine is an ancestor of John Constantine, whom we met in <CITE>Sandman</CITE> #3. We will meet Lady Johanna in later issues.</P>
<P CLASS="anno">The [Grim] Reaper is a traditional appelation for Death, in this form usually represented as a skeletal figure in a dark robe, wielding a scythe.</P>
<P CLASS="panel">Paragraph 13</p>
<p class="anno">We will assume that the reader recognizes and recalls events from earlier issues.</P>
<P CLASS="panel">Paragraph 14</p>
<p class="anno">This, however, is new information. My interpretation is that Dream was engaged in some form of conflict with forces unknown when Burgess cast his spell. The weakened Dream was unable to resist the call. Another hint at this prequel is given in <CITE>Sandman</CITE> #47. Note that Dream is carrying all his tools at the time of his capture. Neil has said that he is interested in writing a miniseries about these events after the main series is concluded.</p>

<h5>Introduction (page 2)</H5>
<P CLASS="panel">Paragraph 4</p>
<p class="anno">The information that the Order was embroiled in a scandal when Sykes and Cripps fled is new.</p>

<h5>Page 1</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">This scene occurs in Washington Square Park, in Greenwich Village, New York City. Many specific details in the artwork confirm this. Several people, including this writer, thought that the arch was intended to be L'Arc de Triomphe, in la Place Charles de Gaulle, Paris, France. In fact, that arch is sufficiently larger than the pictured arch that the Washington Square arch could fit underneath it. The Washington Square arch is at the north end of the park, near a T-intersection of Waverly Place and the end of Fifth Avenue, as pictured. The issue was probably drawn from life or from photographs since the details match so precisely.</P>
<P CLASS="anno">Dream is sitting in a fountain, which is dry in summer only during a drought, which are not uncommon. The dark circular structures on the bottom are caps on the fountainheads. Many people use the fountain in exactly the way Dream is. Considering the lack of crowds, this scene is set on a weekday, or early in the morning. Note the birds. The linkage of Dream with birds is a common motif.</p>

<h5>Page 3</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</p>
<p class="anno">The young woman is Death, Dream's older sister. Note that Death has subsequently been portrayed with a mark around one of her eyes. Mike Dringenberg credits "Cinnamon" as the visual inspiration for Death in <CITE>The Doll's House</CITE>. As we learn later, Death attends all deaths. She is seen attending many deaths in the course of the rest of the series. It is perhaps worth noting that she was not seen at Roderick Burgess's death, nor at the deaths
in the diner in <CITE>Sandman</CITE> #6; Neil, presumably, had not decided exactly how he wanted to use her. Note, also, that the conversation does not take place in a "gallery", a method of formal communication between the Endless demonstrated later in <CITE>The Doll's House</CITE>.</p>

<h5>Page 4</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</p>
<p class="anno"><CITE>Mary Poppins</CITE> was a Disney film of the 60s which mixed live action and animation in an unprecedented manner. Death's description of the movie is accurate.</p>

<h5>Page 5</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">The character in the movie is indeed a banker, or at least a bank manager. "Banker" (or "Merchant Banker") is also standard London rhyming slang for "wanker", an unpleasant person (from "wanking off", or masturbation).</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 7</p>
<p class="anno">Dick van Dyke's line translates to Standard English as "Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Mary Poppins!"</p>

<h5>Page 6</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">Here we clearly see for the first time Death's necklace, which is an ankh, an Egyptian cross that symbolizes life. Note that the chain of the ankh is occasionally missing, as in page 8, panel 3, page 10, panel 2, and others.</p>

<h5>Page 7</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">As I said earlier, Dream is quick to take revenge, but doubts its value afterward.</P> 
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">The recovery of his tools occupies most of Dream's attention in the first major storyline, <CITE>More than Rubies</CITE>, issues #1-7, reprinted in the trade paperback <CITE>Preludes and Nocturnes</CITE>.</p>

<h5>Page 9</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Anthropomorphic means shaped like a man.</p>

<h5>Page 10</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">Desire is another of Dream's siblings.</p>

<h5>Page 11</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Franklin's been wandering around in the background for a while, but he gets named here. This is his first known appearance; he does not appear later, for reasons that will become apparent. Note that he is not wearing shoes here (or the colorist made a mistake), while he is wearing shoes on page 23.</p>

<h5>Page 12</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">Dream is at least two hundred years old. We know from his interaction with J'onn J'onzz in #5 that he is at least as old as Martian civilization, which is implied, I believe, to have ended thousands of years ago.</p>

<h5>Page 13</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">Romany is the name of the Gypsies for themselves and for their language.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">Yid: Yiddish is a Germanic language akin to Middle German. It is spoken by a group of Jews of Germanic origin, in communities across central and southern Europe. The Yiddish people were generally called Ashkenazim or Ashkenazic Jews to distinguish them from the Sephardim or Sephardic Jews, Mediterranean Jews of Spanish origin, expelled from Spain due to religious persecution in 1492. "Yid" means "Jew" in Yiddish. It is a strong racial epithet,
particularly when used in Europe by a Gentile. The American equivalent is probably "kike". Here, used by a Jew, "Yid" may be seen as self-deprecating humor.</p>

<h5>Page 14</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1-2</p>
<p class="anno">This prayer is a traditional Jewish prayer, the "Sh'ma", said in Hebrew. It is essentially the basic element of faith for Judaism. The translation is "Hear, O Israel, the Lord Our God, the Lord is One." It's a declaration of monotheism, the idea by which Judaism
differentiated itself from its neighboring religions. The statement still serves to describe the basic disagreement between Judaism and Christianity's doctrine of the Trinity; "the Lord is One" means not just "as opposed to many" but "as opposed to three-in-one". It is said in every worship service and in numerous other contexts, including, according to tradition, just before death.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Note the painting of the skull, an unusual decoration.
<p class="panel">Panel 7</p>
<p class="anno">Harry finds out about the afterlife, but we don't. We have learned before that there is a Hell, for example; other DC books, particularly <CITE>Swamp Thing</CITE>, have shown other aspects of the afterlife. <CITE>Season of Mists</CITE>, in <CITE>Sandman</CITE> #21-28, is directly concerned with Hell.</p>

<h5>Page 15</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">Death is often portrayed in Christian tradition as being an angel, often specifically the archangel Uriel. Angels are traditionally portrayed as being winged. (A modern example of a winged Death is in the movie <CITE>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</CITE>.)
The portrayal of a winged Death may predate Christianity.</p>

<h5>Page 16</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 7</p>
<p class="anno">The comedian is discussing the Batman story <CITE>A Death in the Family</CITE>, in which the readers could call a special phone number to vote whether Robin lived or died. By a narrow margin, Robin (the second character to use that name), was voted out. Note that Esme of course does not know Batman's secret identity, since the Sandman takes place in the DC (Batman) Universe.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 8</p>
<p class="anno">Note the puns on the fate of the comedian.</p>

<h5>Page 17</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">"Dying on stage" typically means telling jokes that do not succeed. This is a punning reference to that.</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 6</p>
<p class="anno">"The Sunless Lands" would appear to be an appelation for the afterlives. It may be from Greek mythology, the most pleasant section of Hades, where the virtuous dwelt after death. It may also refer to the Sumerian/Babylonian afterlife, which was dusty, dark, and sterile, according to Enkidu's vision in the "Epic of Gilgamesh". Note the interesting characterization of Dream as more terrible than Death.</P>
<P CLASS="anno">"No one here gets out alive" is from a Doors song, "Five to One", from the album <CITE>Waiting for the Sun</CITE> (1968). It was also the title of Doors lead singer Jim Morrison's biography, by Jerry Hopkins and Daniel Sugarman, Warner Books, 1980. Note that it may not be original with Morrison, as he was known to widely use literary sources in his writing.</p>

<h5>Page 18</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">"Booful" is Eastender slang for "beautiful". (Eastenders are from the East End of London.) Aside from this, which may be a dialectical slip on Gaiman's part, the entire issue takes place in New York City.</p>

<h5>Page 19</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">The idea of death as a gift is fairly common. A well-known example is the human race in Tolkien's Middle Earth population. Illuvatar gave them mortality as a gift. Also, in another work of Neil Gaiman, <CITE>Angels &amp; Visitations</CITE>, there is a story set before Creation, in which the angels Carasel and Saraquael define Death to give meaning to Life.</P>
</P>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Note the graffito: "Dreams make no promises". In conjunction with the dead man, this may be seen as a contrast between the siblings' realms.</p>

<h5>Page 19, panel 4<BR>
Page 20, panel 1-2:</H5></P>
<P CLASS="anno">The song to Death is a verse taken from a papyrus, c. 2000 BC, which contains a work called "Dialogue of a Misanthrope with His Soul". The most accessible reference for this is Joseph Campbell's <CITE>Oriental Mythology</CITE>. Campbell cites 19th century German works for
his information. Note that now we know Dream to be "many thousands of years" old; we should by now have the idea that he is immortal and has always existed.</p>

<h5>Page 21</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<p class="anno">Note that the arch is clearly marked "Erected by the People of the City of New York".</p>

<h5>Page 24</H5>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">The wings that Dream is hearing are the pigeons'. Note that Dream's Greek manifestation is traditionally portrayed as having wings, but that we have no reason to think that this version of Dream does so, as one correspondent suggested.</P>
