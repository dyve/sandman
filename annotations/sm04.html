<h5>Title</h5>
<p class="page">&quot;A Hope in Hell&quot; is a contradictio in terminus: In <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> Milton describes Hell as a place where &quot;hope never comes&quot;. In <cite>Inferno</cite> Dante describes an inscription above the gates of Hell reading &quot;Abandon hope all ye enter here.&quot; Hope will be a recurring theme in this issue.</p>

<h5>Cover</h5>
<div class="page">
<p>The words running down the middle panel are from Dante's <cite>Inferno</cite>, in the 1948 translation by Lawrence Grant White. In the 34th and last canto of the poem, the poet and his master reach the lowest pit of hell, where they find the Devil torturing the three worst sinners of all time. The words visible on the cover read:</p>
<blockquote><cite><p>
He thus kept three of them in constant torment.<br>
For him in front, the biting was as naught<br>
Beside the clawing; for, from time to time,<br>
His back was left entirely stripped of skin.<br>
<p>
"That soul up there who suffers greatest pain,"<br>
My master said, "is Judas, the archtraitor,<br>
Who has his head within, and kicks outside.<br>
Those other two whose heads are dangling down<br>
Are Brutus, hanging from the coal-black jaws --<br>
See how he writhes, and utters not a word! --<br>
Cassius the other, who is large of limb.<br>
But night comes on again, and we must go --<br>
For we have seen the whole extent of hell."<br>
<p>
At his command, I clasped him round the neck.<br>
He took advantage of the time and place,<br>
And when the wings were opened wide enough,<br>
He laid firm hold upon the shaggy flanks.<br>
From shag to shag he now went slowly down,<br>
Between the matted hair and crusts of ice.<br>
When we had reached that point just where the thigh<br>
Doth turn upon the thickness of the haunch,<br>
My Leader, with fatigue and labored breath<br>
Brought 'round his head to where his legs had been,<br>
And grasped the hair like one who clambers up,<br>
So that I thought our way lay back to hell.<br>
"Hold fast! For it is by such stairs as these,"<br>
My master said to me with panting breath,<br>
"We must depart from such great wickedness!"<br></cite></blockquote>
<p>The mangled pages on the left and right sides come from the <cite>Purgatorio</cite>, in the same translated edition.</p>

<p class="panel">Panel 7:</p>
<div class="anno"><p>The Morningstar is Lucifer Morningstar, the ruler of Hell. This is the entry for Lucifer from Gustav Davidson's <cite>A Dictionary of Angels</cite>, 1967. Some of his more interesting references are from Francis Barrett's <cite>The Magus</cite>, 1801, and S.L. Mathers' <cite>The Greater Key of Solomon</cite>, 1889:
<p><blockquote>LUCIFER ("light giver")</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><cite>Erroneously equated with the fallen angel (Satan) due to a misreading of 
Isaiah 14:12: "How are thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the 
morning," an apostrophe which applied to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon 
(but see under Satan). It should be pointed out that the authors of the 
books of the Old Testament knew nothing of fallen or evil angels, and do not 
mention them, although, at times, as in Job 4:18, the Lord "put no trust" in 
his angels and "charged them with folly," which would indicate that angels 
were not all they should be. The name Lucifer was applied to Satan by St. 
Jerome and other Church Fathers. Milton in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> applied the name 
to the demon of sinful pride. Lucifer is the title and principal character 
of the epic poem by the Dutch Shakespeare, Vondel (who uses Lucifer in lieu 
of Satan), and a principal character in the mystery play by Imre Madach, 
<cite>The Tragedy of Man</cite>. Blake pictured Lucifer in his illustrations to Dante 
George Meredith's sonnet "Lucifer in Starlight" addresses the "fiend" as 
Prince Lucifer. Actually, Lucifer connotes star, and applies (or originally 
meant to apply) to the morning or evening star (Venus). To Spenser in "An 
Hymne of Heavenly Love," Lucifer is "the brightest angel, even the Child of 
Light."</cite></blockquote></p>
<p>In addition, a character in Roger Zelazny's book <cite>Jack of Shadows</cite> is called Morningstar, and occupies a role analogous to Lucifer.</p>

<p class="panel">Panel 1-4</p>
<p class="anno">This structure resembles Rodin's sculpture, "The Gates of Hell." The sculpture was based on Dante's description in <cite>The Divine Comedy</cite>.</p>

<h5>Page 4</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1-4</p>
<p class="anno">This is not the same gatekeeper as seen elsewhere; first appearance of Squatterbloat. Squatterbloat speaks in triolets; the rhyme scheme is ABAAABAB, and the first, fourth, and seventh lines are the same, as are the second and eighth. The B lines are a syllable or two longer than the A lines. Note that DC has established that demons who rhyme when they speak are higher in Hell's hierarchy than those who do not.</p>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">A new title for Morpheus: "King of the Nightmare Realms".</p>

<h5>Page 5</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">Etrigan first appeared in a Kirby book of the 70s. He is a demon, the son of Belial and the half-brother of Merlin. He shares a body on Earth with Jason Blood, and has since the time of Camelot. Etrigan has had three series, all called <cite>The Demon</cite>. Originally, his speech only sporadically rhymed; the first writer to have Etrigan speak consistently in rhyme was Len Wein (<cite>in DC Comics Presents</cite>). Alan Moore made his poetry more sophisticated by using Shakespeare's iambic parameter. 
Later writers have retained the rhyme but been 
less consistent as to its scheme. I believe John Byrne 
is in the process of trying to restore the original 
version in WONDER WOMAN, in an attempt to go back to 
"the creator's original intent." (On the other hand, he 
doesn't like it when I ask how his version of Superman 
reflected Jerry Siegel's original intent...)
 Etrigan is, to judge by the meter of his speech in several instances, pronounced "eh-tri-GAN", with a short i sound.</p>

<h5>Page 6</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Change is a major theme of the series.</p>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<p class="anno">The Wood of Suicides is from Dante's <cite>Inferno</cite>. It's
in the Second Round of the Seventh Circle. According to John Ciardi's
translation, since they destroyed their bodies, the suicides are therefore
denied a human form in Hell. Furthermore, since the supreme expression of
their life was their destruction, they can only express themselves (i.e:
speak) when they are being destroyed. So long as they bleed, the suicides may
talk; they find expression through their own blood. You will notice that
Morpheus snaps a twig off a passing tree whilst in the Wood. Only then does
the suicide begin to relate his story. The Wood has also appeared in Larry
Niven and Jerry Pournelle's book <cite>Inferno</cite>, which is a modern retelling of
Dante. The Wood may also have appeared in other DC characters' visits to Hell;
I am not sure.</p>

<h5>Page 7</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 3</p>
<p class="anno">Kai'ckul is another name for Morpheus; the prisoner is a woman
named Nada. Nada will be important at least twice more, in a single issue and
a major storyline.</p>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Notice that Dream looks different to Nada; this will be explained in a later issue, when we meet Nada again.</p>

<h5>Page 8</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 1</p>
<div class="anno"><p>Dis (according to my dictionary) is identical with the god
Pluto, or with the underworld of Hades. However, Virgil's <cite>Aeneid</cite> mentions
Dis as a city in the underworld, while Dante's <cite>Inferno</cite> identifies it as the
city occupying the sixth to ninth circles of the Christian Hell. Dis Pater
(literally, "death father") was a Latin god of the underworld, probably once an
ancestral spirit. By classical times, it had become identified with Pluto. 
The name is morphologically similar to Jupiter ("sky father").
</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p>In some texts Lucifer's wings are torn off as part of his punishment, or burned off in the descent to Hell. However, Dante writes (and H.W. Longfellow translates) on the appearance of he wings in XXXIIII.46-51 of the Inferno, when Dante first sees Lucifer:</p>
<p align="center"><blockquote><cite>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,<br>
Such as befitting were so great a bird;<br>
Sails of the sea I never saw so large.<br>
No feathers had they, but as of a bat<br>
Their fashion was; and he was waving them,<br>
So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</cite></blockquote></p>
<p>Additionally, Milton writes (in the Shawcross edition of Milton's poetry) on the origin of the wings in II.630-635 of Paradise Lost, when Satan first starts his journey from Hell to Eden:</p>
<p align="center"><blockquote><cite>Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,<br>
Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design,<br>
Puts on swift wings, and towards the gates of Hell<br>
Explores his solitary flight, som times<br>
He scours the rights hand coast, som times the left,<br>
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soars<br>
Up to the fiery Concave touring high.</cite></blockquote></p>

<p class="page">In the original comic this is a double-page spread. The collections have these two pages as two sides of the same sheet, with replacement art by Mike Dringenberg.</p>

<h5>Page 9</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">"Lucifer" is Latin for "Lightbringer", more or less. Note the
reference to Dream's family, including the first mention of Despair.</p>

<h5>Page 10</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<div class="anno"><p>According to my dictionary, "diumvirate" should be spelled "duumvirate". As a result of the followup (in <cite>Swamp Thing</cite> #50) to <cite>Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite>, Lucifer was forced to accept Beelzebub and Azazel as co-rulers. A different light will be shed upon this in a later storyline. Also, the first storyline in the new run of <cite>The Demon</cite> was tumult and shouting about the ruling of Hell. The triumvirate has also appeared in the secret origin of "Stanley and His Monster" (by Phil Foglio, and very funny, of course, in the later issues of <cite>Secret Origins</cite>).</p>
<p>According to Neil Gaiman, the triumvirate was invented by Alan Grant, who was writing the Demon series, and editor Dan Raspler then required Sandman and Hellblazer to be consistent with that, even though Gaiman thought it was "needless clutter". (At the beginning of Sandman, Gaiman didn't have the clout he has today!) Ironically, the Demon series didn't start coming out until 1990, making Sandman #4 (cover-dated April 1989) the first appearance (as far as I know) of the triumvirate in comics, although it had been referred to very briefly in Hellblazer #12. Alan Grant wanted Beelzebub and Belial as the co-rulers. Gaiman replaced Belial with Azazel because he thought - incorrectly - that Belial was just a variation of Beelzebub, and because he liked Azazel. Neil writes on the subject:</p>
<p><blockquote><cite>
I wanted to change them partly because Beelzebub and Belial are cognate, and partly because I've always been very fond of Azazel -- the goat forced out into the desert, all that... I don't think I'd managed to get my hands on a copy of The Book of Enoch back when I wrote Sandman 4.
</cite></blockquote></p>
<p>And later he writes:</p>
<p><blockquote><cite>Well, whatever book of Demons or Angels I had closest to hand in 1988 listed Belial and Beelzebub as being cognate (or had them both as variants of Baal, more likely). Now, of course, I don't even remember which one that would have been...</cite></blockquote></p>
<p>These are the entries for Azazel and Beelzebub in <cite>A Dictionary of Angels</cite></p>
<p><blockquote>AZAZEL (Azael, Hazazel, "God Strengthens")</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><cite>In <cite>Enoch I</cite>, Azazel is one of the chiefs of the 200 fallen angels (Revelation speaks of one-third of the heavenly host being involved in the fall). Azazel "taught men to fashion swords and shields" while women learned from him "finery and the art of beautifying the eyelids." He is the scapegoat in rabinnic literature, Targum, and in Leviticus 16:8, although in the latter he is not actually named. In <cite>The Zohar</cite> (Vayeze 153a) the rider on the serpent is symbolized by "the evil Azazel." Here he is said to be chief of the order of bene elim (otherwise ischim, lower angles, "men-spirits"). Irenaeus calls Azazel "that fallen and yet mighty angel." In <cite>The Apocalypse of
Abraham</cite> he is "lord of hell, seducer of mankind," and here his aspect, when revealed in its true form, shows him to be a demon with 7 serpent heads, 14 faces, and 12 wings. Jewish legend speaks of Azazel as the angel who refused to bow down before Adam (in the Koran the
angel is Eblis or Iblis) when the 1st human was presented to <sic> God to the assembled hierarchs in Heaven. For such refusal, Azazel was thence dubbed "the accursed Satan." [Rf. Babmurger, <cite>Fallen Angels</cite>, p.278.] According to the legend in Islamic lore, when God commanded the angels to worship Adam, Azazel refused, contending "Why should a
son of fire [i.e., an angel] fall down before a son of clay [i.e., a mortal]?" Whereupon God cast Azazel out of Heaven and changed his name to Eblis. Milton in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> I, 534 describes Azazel as "a cherub tall," but also as a fallen angel and Satan's standard
bearer. Originally, according to Maurice Bouisson in <cite>Magic; its History and Principal Rites</cite>, Azazel was an ancient Semitic god of the flocks who was later degraded to the level of a demon. [Rf. Trevor Ling, <cite>The Significance of Satan in New Testament Demonology</cite>]
Bamberger in <cite>Fallen Angels</cite> inclines to the notion that the first star which fell (star here having the meaning of angel) was Azazel.</cite></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>BEELZEBUB (Belzebud, Belzaboul, Beezeboul, Baalsebul, etc., "god of
flies")</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><cite>Originally a Syrian god, Beelzebub is in II Kings 1:3, a god of Ekron in 
Philistia. In the cabala, he is chief of the 9 evil hierarchies of the 
underworld. In Matthew 10:25, Mark 3:22, and Luke 40:15, Beelzebub is chief 
of the demons, "prince of the devils" (as in Matthew 12:24), but he is to be 
distinguished from Satan (just as he is in all magic, medieval or 
otherwise). [Rf. Legge, <cite>Forerunners and Rivals of Christianity</cite> 9,108.] In 
the <cite>Gospel of Nicodemus</cite>, Christ, during his 3 days in Hell, gives 
Beelzebub dominion over the underworld in gratitude for premitting him 
(Christ), over Satan's objections, to take Adam and the other "saints in 
prison" to Heaven. Another of his titles was "lord of chaos", as given in 
the Gnostic writings of Valentinus. Dante indentifies Beelzebub with Satan, 
but Milton in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> I,79, ranks Beelzebub "next to Satan in power 
and crime;" in I,157 Satan addresses Beelzebub as a "fallen cherub." In 
Hayley's edition of <cite>The Poetical Works of John Milton</cite> (london, 1794), 
there is an illustration showing "Satan conferring with Belzebuth." In 
Gurdjieff's <cite>All and Everything, Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson</cite>, the 
hero is Beelzebub.</cite></blockquote></p>

<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">The reference to the dead god is explained in <cite>Sandman</cite> #49.</p>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>
<div class="anno"><p>This is the demon from <cite>Sandman</cite> #1, identified on page 16 for the first time as Choronzon, who appears in the writings of Aleister Crowley.</p>
<p>From <cite>Cosmic Trigger: Final Secret of the Illuminati</cite> by Robert Anton Wilson we learn that there was a connection between Choronzon, Aleister Crowley and the historical Dr. John Dee (see the <a href="sm02.html" onmouseover="window.status='Read the Annotations for issue 2'; return true;" onmouseout="window.status='';">Annotations for issue 2</a>):</p>
<p><blockquote><cite>333 is the Cabalistic number of 'that mighty devil, Choronzon,' who once
afflicted Dr. Dee in the 17th Century and gave Aleister himself a rough
time in Bou Saada, North Africa, 1909, as recounted in <cite>The Vision and
the Voice</cite>, by Aleister Crowley.</cite></blockquote></p>
</div>
<h5>Page 16</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">Note that the way Choronzon talks does not match issue 1, page 16, panels 3-5. Actually, judging by the text and the balloons, the demon in issue 1 resembles Beelzebub. Choronzon is identified on panel 1 as &quot;a duke of Hell, one of Beelzebub's&quot;.</p>

<h5>Page 15</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 7</p>
<p class="anno">This game resembles a transformation combat, which is common enough in folklore and mythology that it has an entry in the multi-volume <cite>Motif-index of folk-literature</cite> by Stith Thompson. Some examples are <cite>The Magician and his Pupil</cite> (#68 in the Grimms' collection), <cite>The 12th Captain's Tale</cite> in the Arabian Nights, the story of Taliesin in Welsh mythology, and in T.H. White's <cite>The Sword in the Stone</cite>. In transformation combat, however, the contestants actually transform into the creatures or things that they describe, while Morpheus and Choronzon merely discuss (and illustrate) what they become. The game of reality is quite similar thematically to the Riddle Game of old, which is exemplified in J.R.R. Tolkien's <cite>The Hobbit</cite>.</p>

<h5>Page 16</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 2</p>
<p class="anno">&quot;The Hellfire Club&quot; is a joke of course. The Hellfire Club was also referenced in the <a href="sm01.html" onmouseover="window.status='Read the Annotations for issue 1'; return true;" onmouseout="window.status='';">Annotations for issue 1.</a></p>

<p class="anno">I am aware of no predilection in snakes for spider-devouring.</p>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">In <cite>The Sword in the Stone</cite> the players (Merlin and Madame Mimm) set limits on the game, preventing them from becoming abstractions. Merlin eventually wins by turning into a virus, just like Choronzon does here.</p>
<p class="panel">Panel 5</p>

<h5>Page 19</h5>
<p class="panel">Panel 4</p>
<p class="anno">Choronzon takes the role of the &quot;Anti-Life&quot;.  This could be a reference to the Anti-Life Equation, which is continually sought after by Darkseid (of the New Gods) in the DC universe.</p>

<p class="page">This is John Dee, Dr. Destiny, who has been mentioned before. The

Choronzon; it allegedly protects the wearer from "anything", and it is known to
work against magical sendings.</p>
