<h2>Children's Crusade</h2>

<p>In 1993-94, DC published a series of 7 inter-related Vertigo annuals, titled <cite>Children's Crusade</cite>. The first installment, <cite>Children's Crusade</cite> #1, is credited &quot;by Neil Gaiman and Chris Bachalo&quot;. The last, <cite>Children's Crusade</cite> #2, has sections written by Gaiman, Alisa Kwitney and Jamie Delano, with art by Peter Snejbjerg.</p>

<p>The five installments in between are Black Orchid Annual #1 (featuring Suzy, the baby BO), Animal Man Annual #1 (featuring Maxine, AM's daughter), Swamp Thing Annual #7 (featuring Tefe), Doom Patrol Annual #2 (featuring Dorothy),
and Arcane Annual #1 (pre-Books of Magic series) featuring Tim Hunter.</p>

<p>The story revolves around a group of children gone missing in an alternate-dimension land called Free Country -- part Pied Piper, part JM Barrie Neverland -- and the efforts of the Vertigo kids to keep it from being destroyed. The tale also stars a pair of unlikely detectives: Edwin Paine and Charles Rowland, the two dead boys from <cite>Sandman</cite> #25.</p>

<p>In <cite>Children's Crusade</cite> #1, Neil recaps the historical story of the Children's Crusade of 1512, when an "army of innocents" was recruited to fight in Jerusalem, but were sold into slavery instead (an event that also gave rise to a central motif in Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot;).</p>
