<b>NEIL GAIMAN AND CHARLES VESS'</b>
<h1>STARDUST</h1>

<p><i>Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess</i></p>

<p>Collects Stardust #1-4</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Every nine years, a fair is held in the village of Wall. Every nine years, the worlds of Faerie and man mingle instead of touch. Tristan Thorn is born of a union between a fairy woman and a mortal man, is raised as a man, and travels to Faerie to find a fallen star and his heart's desire.</p>

<p>Once in Faerie, he learns more than he probably wanted about the realm, about its inhabitants, about himself, and about what it is he wants.</p>

<p>Gaiman and Vess tell a modern fantasy fairy tale, both in pictures and words, and take you away to a magical land. Perhaps you will live happily ever after.</p>

</blockquote>
