<h1>DUST COVERS</h1>

<p><i>Dave McKean</i></p>

<p>Comments and notes by Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman</p>

<p>Collects the covers of all published Sandman issues as well as interior illustrations for the collections and previously unpublished work</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dave McKean's beautiful covers are all collected here, on high quality paper. Both Neil and Dave tell about the creation of the covers, and while doing so, they talk about <cite>Sandman</cite>. After reading the small print beside the illustrations, you will know that Dave McKean really likes fish, that the <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite> issue was used in a murder, and that the world has never been the same since Dave McKean started using a computer.</p>

<p><cite>Dust Covers</cite> also contains <cite>The Last Sandman Story</cite>, written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Dave McKean. I would say that it is a beautiful little piece of fiction, but according to Neil I might be wrong during the night. However, it is a beautiful little piece.</p>

<p>Published in England by <b>Titan Books</b>, both in hardback and paperback format.</p>
