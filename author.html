<h1>AUTHOR</h1>

<p>Neil Gaiman was born November 10, 1960. He lives in an odd, rambling house of uncertain location, where he writes in a basement room filled with books and old armchairs. He has two cats, who are both quite mad, and three children, who are, to his occasional surprise, fairly sane, and a very nice wife. He has received a number of awards, and, while he no longer believes that being a grown-up is all it's cracked up to be, still enjoys staying up after his bed-time.</p>
